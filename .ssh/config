# NOTE: Control* settings are advanced. They can cause SSH to break in
# unexpected ways, but yield a substantial speed up when you
# repeatedly login to remote machines.  If you enable them, make sure
# you read the man pages and understand the consequences.

# Always order configs from most-specific to least specific since the first
# value found for a setting is used.

# Run `man ssh_config` for more explanation of the settings.
